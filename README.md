# About the layout of the App:
    Components:
        * Header - The main navigation bar that should persist to every page. Controls state for logging in/out
        * Home - The main product landing page for "Anywhere Fitness"


    Known Bugs:
        * 1 - The 'Home' button on the nav bar adjusts the size of the nav container on hover, but none of the other buttons do this. Likely a bug in the CSS. Low prio.
        * 2 - Fix the Footer to always be positioned at the bottom of pages but only visible at the bottom. Position: fixed works but it persists on scrollin content.
